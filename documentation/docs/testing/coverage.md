## Purpose
A test coverage report provides insights into how much of the codebase is exercised by the tests. This helps identify untested areas, ensuring that all critical system components and functionalities are validated.

## Interpreting the Report
- Any areas with low coverage should be reviewed to determine if additional tests are needed.
- Uncovered lines may indicate untested functionality or dead code that should be refactored.
- Ideally, aim for 80-90%+ coverage to ensure thorough testing while balancing practicality.
